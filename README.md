# New Main Menu for Wizard with a Gun
This is the second modification to the game Wizard With a Gun (Demo)

It replaces the standard eye color of the Player Character with a rotating set of rainbow eyes.

## Installation
### Installing BepInEx
1. Download the BepInEx ZIP File from the official BepInEx repository. I have used version 5.4.21 found [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21)
2. Use the version that is right for you. In most cases, this should be `BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0.zip`
3. Extract the BepInEx ZIP File into the games "root" folder
   
   3.1. To elaborate: Download the ZIP File from the link above, then extract its contents into the main folder of your WWAG Steam Installation. This is most commonly under:
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Wizard with a Gun Demo`
   When finished,  you should have a new folder called `BepInEx` in your WWAG Game folder, as well as a few new files.
5. Run the game with BepInEx Installed atleast once. This will generate needed Config files and folders in your WWAG Game directory
6. Close the game

### Installing the mod
1. Download the latest release of the mod found [here](https://github.com/RandomWolf/WWAG_RainbowEyes/releases/tag/Release)
2. Extract the Contents of the ZIP file into `Wizard with a Gun Demo\BepInEx\plugins\WWAG_NewIntro.dll`

The mod should now be installed.

## Configuration
Upon first launch, the mod will generate a Config in the `BepInEx\config` folder in your games directory. In here, you can change the speed of the rainbow.
